<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate under the advisory of Prof. [Kai Zheng](https://zheng-kai.com/) and Prof. [Defu Lian](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~liandefu/) in School of Computer Science and Engineering, [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). I got my B.S. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2018. My research interests include data mining, especially on efficient recommender systems.
